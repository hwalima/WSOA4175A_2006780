      Size, perspective- large objects, when you make them too 3D, you dimensionalize them too much, they appear tiny,

    <p style="text-align: justify;">Enabling 3D perspective on an element makes it possible to move, rotate, and scale
      objects in 3D space. I set perspective on a parent element and have it affect all of its children, and the element
      itself. Both options unlock 3D transforms. In this explanation I cover the options I used for 3D perspective, and
      explain to scale elements on the z-axis: </p>

    <ul class="b">
      <li>No perspective</li>
      <li>Children perspective</li>
      <li>Self-perspective</li>
      <li>Scaling along the z-axis</li>
    </ul>

      <p class="firstpara"><strong class="firstcharacter">I</strong>nspired by @TatsuyaBot’s tweet on motion design, I
        decided to make similar motion cubes, but without JavaScript. However, after a while, the stillness of the cube
        fast became boring. The final iteration was the addition of a mouse follow script to the code. <br><br>
        The whole exercise was aimed at stretching the capabilities of HTML and CSS in web art. The tedious process
        involved dozens of repeated lines of HTML trigger and response sections.
      </p>
      <ul class="b">
        <li>Part 1: trigger</li>
        <li>Part 2: on hover</li>
        <li>Part 3: monitor</li>
      </ul>

      <section class="pause" id="i"><a href="#i">The created 3d perspective is not 3d at all, things are flattened to
          appear as if they were two-dimensional. to set a 3d perspective, I had to do three things:</a></section>
      <ul class="b">
        <li>Setting a children perspective on a parent element</li>
        <li>Setting a self-perspective on an element itself</li>
        <li>Scaling along the z-axis. </li>
      </ul>
      <img src="./images/triggers.png" alt="triggers" width="100" height="100" />

      <p>Rotating the shape about the y axis was two-dimensional and boring. For a while, that was fine since the shape
        inside my section, and I wanted to set the section to sort of act like a camera.
        With my section selected, I set children's perspective, to 1000 pixels. <br><br>
        The higher the value the more flattened effect I got. The lover the value, the more dramatic effect I got. <br>
        Here are a bunch of section blocks nothing special about them, except that there are a lot of them. Now the same
        trigger class is applied to each one of these section blocks. And as I rotate them, the perspective is what you
        might expect if the viewport was a camera, the perspective is set on the section we've set a child perspective
        if we go into the section and remove that we already know we have that flattening effect, nothing looks 3d
        because no perspective has been set.
      </p>

      <p>Finally, the scaling along the z-axis, plain page three buttons, they're in a section block that section block
        is inside another section. Each of these sections is rotated along the X and the Y-axis. The Y-axis is the
        negative value of the X-axis. This created a complementary viewpoint

      <h2>Z-axis</h2>
      <p>Scaling along the z-axis works on parent elements that have children with varying z values. So children's
        perspective, great for making any element serve as a camera setting perspective relative to that parent element.
        Cell perspectives enable 3d controls on an element without setting perspective on its parent. And finally,
        scaling along the z-axis. This scales objects along the z-axis that have varying z values.</p>
