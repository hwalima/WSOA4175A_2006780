      First we thought the PC was a calculator. Then we found out how to turn numbers into letters with ASCII- and
      thought it was a typewritter. Then we discovered graphics, and thought it was a television. With the World Wide
      Web, we've realised its a brochure.

    <p style="text-align: justify;">Running under the popular Ad Reinhardt quote: “Art is art. Everything else is
      everything else.” I seek to make a website whose various components are art in nature. Starting with the footer
      that represents escaping gas, I began with many ideas on how to stretch the capabilities of CSS in web art making.

      <h2>Inspiration</h2>

      <p class="firstpara"><strong class="firstcharacter">O</strong>ne of the most fascinating milestones in internet
        and digital technology is the ASCII table. ASCII, abbreviation of American Standard Code for Information
        Interchange, is a standard data-transmission code that is used by smaller and less-powerful computers to
        represent both textual data (letters, numbers, and punctuation marks) and noninput-device commands (control
        characters).
      </p>


      <section class="pause" id="i"><a href="#i">For me, the way the ASCII table appears as an image looks artistic.
          Adding on the artistic components of the website like the footer, I wish to experiment with the art of ASCII.
          as a web user that comes from the dial up internet age, the various images of the ASCII table are
          nostalgic.</a></section>

      <p>Expanding on basic ASCII art like the endless horse by Colleen Josephson and Kyle Miller, this website will be
        a combination of Image based SCII -art, pseudo-Art and Command line Art. The art will be mainly substitutions of
        images with the characters available in the ASCII table. this will create a calligraphy collection, treating a
        collection of brushstrokes as typography.

      <h2>Final thought</h2>
      <p>The final vision of the website is to allow the coexistence of artistic elements of the website, at the same
        time creating a nostalgic effect with art.</p>
