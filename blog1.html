    <p style="text-align: justify;">Notwithstanding the fact that the covid-19 pandemic caught the entire world ill
      prepared, the western medical system had been built for many years against the backbone of the affordance s of
      digital access. The National health system in the United Kingdom has been building the telehealth system. Besides
      having these affordances, the digital divide is still evident. For example, according to the 2018 Broadband
      Deployment Report, only 69.3% of rural areas and 64.6% of tribal areas had access to high-speed broadband internet
      that met the minimum benchmark set by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).</p>

      <p class="firstpara"><strong class="firstcharacter">I</strong>n their reflection, Tataki and Glyno highlight the
        impact of COVID-19 on vulnerable employees by equating the lack of a university degree to increased chances of
        retrenchment. Moreover, these low-income earners usually do not have sufficient data to work from home, and
        their children do not have the data to study from home. What this means is that the whole family is plunged
        deeper into poverty when the parents cannot work and the children cannot study, bringing into reality the old
        saying “the richer get richer and the poorer get poorer”</p>
      <section class="pause" id="i"><a href="#i">Social distancing.</a></section>
      <p>Reflecting on the effects of social distancing, this meant that people who rely on manual work like
        construction workers could not travel or do their work. Once again, these are the low-income earners who are
        affected.</p>

      <p>The October 2021 issue of PC mag highlights concerns that the installation of the new windows 11, whether from
        an ISO file, upgrade, or otherwise, requires a stable internet connection. Not only defeating Microsoft's matra
        on inclusivity, but such software requirement also widens the digital divide. It seems here Microsoft threw the
        bathing water of its mantra out of the window, together with their baby they named “a PC for every child”. </p>

    <p>In a continent where schools, hospitals, and even police stations do not have internet connectivity. Such
      development by the software giant further widens the digital divide.</p>
