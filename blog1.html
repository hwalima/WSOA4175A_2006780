    <p>Bataille's analysis of predialectic objectivism holds that culture is used in the service of archaic, sexist
      perceptions of art. A number of constructions concerning capitalist objectivism may be found. However, the primary
      theme of von Ludwig's[2] model of pretextual capitalist theory is the bridge between society and class. If
      capitalist objectivism holds, we have to choose between predialectic objectivism and Lacanist obscurity.</p>

      <p class="firstpara"><strong class="firstcharacter">H</strong>ypertext, used in the wake of the computing era, can
        be defined as new media. Wardrip-Fruin aligns his argument to those of the early 1660’s software engineers like
        Nelson and Englebert, where separate
        pieces of text or pictures can be connected by links. New media hypertext, however, differs from Nelson’s
        original vision of hypertext in that we do not read hypertext the same way we read a novel, and browsing the Web
        is a different experience
        from reading a book or newspaper (Vandendorpe, 2009)</p>
      <p>Looking at hypertext in the era of social media, we can propose questions about the technology being an
        extension of socio-cultural practices. The ability to click on a link, tweet and retweet. Then click on the
        retweet and use it as a meme
        caption. Hypertext is not just as an idea but as a matter of social practice (Barnet, 2013).</p>
      <section class="pause" id="i"><a href="#i">Flexibility.</a></section>
      <p>While hypertext provides greater flexibility and convenience than conventional documents, its power and appeal
        increase dramatically when it is implemented in computing environments that include networked microcomputers and
        workstations, high-resolution
        displays, and large on-line storage. While following a cross-reference in an 88-volume encyclopedia can take
        several minutes, many hypertext systems can deliver the next node in less than a second and from a much larger
        body of information
        that might take thousands of volumes in print. While conventional publications are limited to text and graphics,
        hypertext nodes offer sound navigation.</p> <br>
      <p>A hypertext system may have only one type of link or many types. In the web medium, the active, and the visited
        links are visible. When a user selects a link, the display of the new node replaces the original node, or it may
        share the display
        via an overlapping window.</p>

        allowfullscreen></iframe>
      <p>In some systems, the user can partition the screen in separate windows where different nodes are displayed.
        Links can be unidirectional or bidirectional. A bidirectional link allows you to traverse the link from either
        end. Links are usually
        given names that may or may not be shown to the user. </p>
