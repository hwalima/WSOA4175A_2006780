    <p style="text-align: justify;">C³ is an institution concerned with prevailing innovation and supports and develops
      projects that do not serve direct commercial interests, often precisely because their uncommon, novel
      comprehension does not necessarily allow for hopes of market support.</p>

      <h2>Aura</h2>

      <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iKuAcffzFRI" title="YouTube video player"

        allowfullscreen></iframe>
      <p class="firstpara"><strong class="firstcharacter">T</strong>he departing point of this analysis is the debate
        on the preservation of the original aura of the collection of the works of art by C3. The term aura was
        originally coined by Walter Benjamin, a German Jewish philosopher in his essay called the work of art in the age
        of mechanical reproduction. In the essay, Benjamin underpins that the main problem of modernity is majorly the
        use of “mass” in many of its spheres (mass media, mass commodification, mass reproduction, etc.).</p>

      <section class="pause" id="i"><a href="#i">Drawing from Benjamin’s work, aura is a term that connotes the unique
          one-time existential experience of a work of art when situated in a unique position in a time era and
          context.</a></section>

      <p>By presenting various forms of medial art archived in a periodic table art style, C3 unlocks a democratic world
        of archiving which lives in a digital format. Also, this world is participatory by inviting the viewer directly
        into the world of the artists in the collection. Furthermore, entering the “periodic table” lands a user into a
        3D game-like website that uses diegetic devices and metaphors to guides the user. For example, a bridge
        represents connections and the revolving sign of 19 invites participants that are 19 years of age or younger.
        This presentation is game art that is intermediated into internet art.</p>

      <p>In his article: The Work of Art in the Age of the Internet, David Carrier pinpoints March 2020 as the
        trend-setting event that transformed art galleries as we know them. The covid-19 pandemic has shifted art
        galleries from white cubes to online engagements for the comfort of couches.

      </p>


      <p>However, C3 has long started these online exhibitions before the Covid 19 pandemic. The aura had long changed.
        This raises questions of data geographies. Who would have known that a collection of web art from Hungary
        Budapest
        could have set the trend? Moreover, will C3 be ever applauded for fore sighting this trend? The shift is of
        cause,
        felt when traditional institutes like art galleries are disturbed.</p>

    <section class="article">
      <h2>What shall we say?</h2>
      <p>C3 has therefore traditionally sacrificed its aura to create a gallery without walls, where analysis is posted
        on
        fixed walls called the website. Would we say then, and accept, that this is the befitting aura, a new
        traditional
        format?</p>
      <p>In his earlier works: Wild Art (Phaidon, 2013), Carrier argues that this form of breakaways in the forms of
        art, coined wild-art, is fuelled by the present effect of the internet. Thus, the success of C3 whether known as
        a pioneering piece of work or not is anchored by the affordances of the internet.</p>

        frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
        allowfullscreen></iframe>

      <p>For C3 it seems The original physical object is now merely the source, just as the author’s manuscript is the
        source of a novel, and the reproduction has become a genuine replacement for that object</p>
